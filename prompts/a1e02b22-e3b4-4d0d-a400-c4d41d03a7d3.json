  "original": "The toothpaste tube floats in the center of a clean white void. The tube compresses magically as if squeezed by an invisible force. A stream of toothpaste shoots out in a slow-motion arc, landing on a toothbrush. Clean 3D render style, pristine white background, smooth motion. but the toothbrush has to be in the lower front of the tub where it is clearly visible and a realisitic toothbrush as well so the toothpaste comes on naturally, also put it into a natrual background",
  "refined": "The Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection toothpaste tube from the input image, with its vibrant red and deep blue glossy finish and white ribbed screw cap, floats centered above a pristine, minimalist white bathroom counter. A realistic, ergonomic white toothbrush with bright blue bristles is positioned in the lower foreground, clearly visible and ready to receive the paste. The flexible tube subtly compresses as if by an invisible force, and a thick, pearlescent white stream of toothpaste smoothly extrudes from the nozzle. The camera performs a slow, deliberate dolly push-in, following the toothpaste as it forms a graceful arc and lands precisely onto the toothbrush bristles. Bright, soft, diffused light highlights the product's glossy surface and the toothpaste's texture, creating a clean, fresh, and hygienic atmosphere with smooth, pristine motion.",
