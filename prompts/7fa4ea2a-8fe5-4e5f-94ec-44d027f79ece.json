  "original": "The toothpaste tube floats in the center of a clean white void. The tube compresses magically as if squeezed by an invisible force. A stream of toothpaste shoots out in a slow-motion arc, landing on a toothbrush. Clean 3D render style, pristine white background, smooth motion. but the toothbrush has to be in the lower front of the tub where it is clearly visible so the toothpaste comes on naturally, also put it into a natrual background",
  "refined": "A pristine, bright bathroom counter serves as the setting for a high-definition product shot. The Colgate toothpaste tube from the input image, showcasing its glossy red, deep blue, and white packaging with the distinctive white \"Colgate\" logo and ribbed white cap, lies horizontally in the mid-ground. A clean white toothbrush is positioned in the lower foreground, clearly visible and ready to receive the toothpaste. The video begins with a slow, steady push-in towards the tube. With a smooth, controlled motion, the toothpaste tube visibly compresses, and a thick, white stream of toothpaste emerges from the cap, arcing gracefully in slow motion. The camera subtly dollies up to follow the elegant trajectory as the toothpaste lands perfectly on the bristles of the toothbrush. Bright, soft, and even studio lighting illuminates the scene, emphasizing the product's clean aesthetic. The atmosphere is fresh, precise, and hygienic, with deliberate, smooth motion throughout.",
