  "original": "Generate an 6-second, artisanal video ad for making fresh pasta. Begin with close-ups of ingredients (flour, eggs) and hands kneading the dough. Transition to a rapid, realistic montage showing the dough being rolled, cut, cooked in boiling water, and tossed with sauce. All transitions must be natural cuts or realistic camera moves—avoid non-realistic visual effects. Conclude with a steaming bowl of the finished pasta and a text overlay like 'Simple. Fresh. Authentic.' Emphasize warm colors, tactile textures, and the authentic sounds of cooking.",
  "refined": "A cinematic video ad for artisanal fresh pasta, set in a warm, rustic kitchen bathed in soft, natural light. The video begins with a close-up of skilled hands kneading pale yellow dough on a floured wooden surface, emphasizing the tactile textures. A gentle dolly movement then reveals the polished stainless steel manual pasta maker from the input image, with its black crank handle, as a person's hands expertly feed a sheet of dough through the cutting rollers, producing long, delicate strands of fresh fettuccine. The camera smoothly follows the pasta falling onto a clean surface, then transitions to the strands being gently dropped into a pot of bubbling, steaming water. The scene concludes with a pull-back shot of a steaming bowl of freshly tossed pasta, simply garnished, showcasing warm, inviting colors and a cozy, authentic atmosphere. The motion throughout is deliberate and fluid, capturing the craft and freshness of homemade pasta.",
