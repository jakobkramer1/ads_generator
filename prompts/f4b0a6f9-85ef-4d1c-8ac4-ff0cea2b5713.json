  "original": "Generate an 6-second, artisanal video ad for making fresh pasta. Begin with close-ups of ingredients (flour, eggs) and hands kneading the dough. Transition to a rapid, realistic montage showing the dough being rolled, cut, cooked in boiling water, and tossed with sauce. All transitions must be natural cuts or realistic camera moves—avoid non-realistic visual effects. Conclude with a steaming bowl of the finished pasta and a text overlay like 'Simple. Fresh. Authentic.' Emphasize warm colors, tactile textures, and the authentic sounds of cooking.",
  "refined": "A pair of hands, dressed in a muted grey shirt and a light beige apron, skillfully operates a gleaming, silver stainless steel manual pasta machine. The camera opens with a focused shot on the hand turning the crank, then smoothly dollies out to reveal a smooth, pale yellow sheet of fresh pasta dough being fed into the rollers. As the crank continues to turn, long, delicate strands of tagliatelle-style pasta emerge from the machine, gracefully coiling onto a lightly floured wooden countertop. Warm, natural light streams in from a window, creating soft highlights on the machine's polished surface and emphasizing the dough's soft texture. The scene conveys a sense of artisanal craftsmanship and the satisfying rhythm of making fresh, homemade pasta.",
