  "original": "The toothpaste tube floats in the center of a clean white void. The tube compresses magically as if squeezed by an invisible force. A stream of toothpaste shoots out in a slow-motion arc, landing on a toothbrush. Clean 3D render style, pristine white background, smooth motion. but the toothbrush has to be in the lower front of the tub so the toothpaste comes on naturally",
  "refined": "In a pristine, brightly lit white studio, the glossy, red and blue Colgate toothpaste tube from the input image, with its distinctive white logo and ribbed white cap, floats horizontally. The tube subtly compresses as if by an unseen force, and a thick, white stream of toothpaste elegantly emerges in a graceful slow-motion arc, landing precisely onto the bristles of a clean, white toothbrush positioned slightly below the tube. The camera maintains a steady, eye-level shot, smoothly tracking the toothpaste's precise motion. The scene conveys a hyper-realistic 3D render aesthetic with crisp focus and soft, even lighting, highlighting the product's vibrant colors and clean action.",
