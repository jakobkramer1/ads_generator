  "original": "Generate an 8-second, highly sophisticated and sensual video ad for the Louis Vuitton fragrance shown in the image. The sequence must move from a close-up bottle shot (0-2s) to evocative, cinematic imagery representing the scent's feeling (3-6s), and conclude with a clean product shot and luxury tagline (7-8s). Use rich, warm colors, smooth camera movement, and an overall elegant tone.",
  "refined": "A sophisticated and sensual video advertisement for the Louis Vuitton \"IMAGINATION\" fragrance. The video begins with a slow, deliberate push-in, focusing intimately on the matte black cap of the sleek, cylindrical glass bottle from the input image, highlighting the silver LV logo engraved on its top. As the camera smoothly pulls back and performs a subtle 180-degree rotation, the translucent light blue liquid within the bottle is revealed, along with the distinct black \"IMAGINATION\" text and the embossed \"LOUIS VUITTON\" branding on the glass. The background transitions from a clean studio setting into a dreamlike, ethereal landscape, bathed in rich, warm golden hour light and soft, slow-moving, abstract mist that swirls sensually around the bottle. This evocative atmosphere, suggestive of boundless imagination, builds for a few moments, with the bottle remaining the central, elegant anchor. The camera then gently settles into a pristine, stable hero shot of the bottle, perfectly centered on a reflective, minimalist surface, against a backdrop of soft, diffused amber and peach tones, allowing for a luxury tagline to appear. The overall motion is fluid and elegant, with soft focus and deliberate pacing.",
