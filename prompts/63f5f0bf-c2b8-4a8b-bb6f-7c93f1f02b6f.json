  "refined": "A serene, sun-drenched outdoor patio, framed by soft, out-of-focus greenery. The sleek, white mineral sunscreen bottle from the input image, with its minimalist design, rests on a light stone table. The camera begins with a medium shot, slowly dollying forward as a woman with sun-kissed skin reaches for the bottle. She dispenses a generous amount of the creamy white sunscreen onto her forearm, which is then highlighted in a gentle close-up. Her fingers move smoothly and gracefully as she rubs the product into her skin, blending it seamlessly. A warm, genuine smile radiates across her face, reflecting the serene and healthy atmosphere. Soft, golden hour sunlight casts a natural glow, emphasizing the product's texture and the healthy sheen on her skin. The motion is fluid and serene, conveying a sense of natural beauty and protection.",
