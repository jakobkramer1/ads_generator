  "original": "Generate an elegant video ad for a flower shop. Start with a close-up of fresh, vibrant flowers, then show a florist's hands carefully selecting and arranging stems into a beautiful bouquet. All transitions must be natural cuts or realistic camera moves—avoid non-realistic effects. Conclude with the finished, stunning bouquet held by the florist, or beautifully displayed, with a text overlay like 'Artistry in Bloom.' Emphasize natural light, delicate details, and the sounds of creation.",
  "refined": "In a bright, serene flower studio, the florist from the input image, wearing a light blue turtleneck and a black apron with delicate pink straps, is meticulously arranging an assortment of fresh, vibrant blossoms. Her hands, holding a slender yellow tool and various green stems, delicately intertwine colorful petals and foliage. The camera opens with a medium close-up focused on her hands and the evolving bouquet, slowly pushing in to highlight the intricate textures of the petals and the subtle movements of her fingers. Soft, natural light bathes the scene, creating gentle highlights on the flowers and emphasizing the focused artistry. The video concludes with a smooth, slow pull-back, revealing a beautifully composed, partially-formed bouquet taking shape in her hands, embodying a sense of calm creation and delicate craftsmanship.",
