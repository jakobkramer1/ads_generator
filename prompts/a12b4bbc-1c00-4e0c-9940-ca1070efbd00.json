  "original": "Generate an 8-second, artisanal video ad for making fresh pasta. Begin with close-ups of ingredients (flour, eggs) and hands kneading the dough (0-2s). Transition to a rapid, realistic montage showing the dough being rolled, cut, cooked in boiling water, and tossed with sauce (3-6s). All transitions must be natural cuts or realistic camera moves—avoid non-realistic visual effects. Conclude with a steaming bowl of the finished pasta and a text overlay like 'Simple. Fresh. Authentic.' (7-8s). Emphasize warm colors, tactile textures, and the authentic sounds of cooking.",
  "refined": "A warm, inviting kitchen scene filled with natural daylight. The video opens with a close-up on a rustic wooden countertop, showcasing a small mound of golden flour and a couple of fresh eggs. Gentle hands, wearing a light-colored apron, begin kneading a soft, pliable dough. The camera performs a slow, upward dolly, revealing the polished stainless steel manual pasta maker from the input image, positioned centrally on the counter. A sheet of the golden dough is carefully fed into the rollers of the pasta maker as the hand turns the black crank handle with smooth, steady motion. The camera tracks closely as the dough is flattened and then precisely cut into long, delicate strands of fresh pasta, falling gracefully onto the floured surface. The freshly made pasta glistens under the warm light. The shot smoothly transitions to a steaming bowl of perfectly cooked fettuccine, lightly tossed and garnished with fresh green herbs, resting on the same wooden surface. Soft backlighting emphasizes the rising steam, creating an authentic, comforting, and artisanal atmosphere.",
