  "original": "Generate an elegant video ad for a flower shop. Start with a close-up of fresh, vibrant flowers, then show a florist's hands carefully selecting and arranging stems into a beautiful bouquet. All transitions must be natural cuts or realistic camera moves—avoid non-realistic effects. Conclude with the finished, stunning bouquet held by the florist, or beautifully displayed, with a text overlay like 'Artistry in Bloom.' Emphasize natural light, delicate details, and the sounds of creation.",
  "refined": "A high-end flower shop advertisement: The video opens with a soft close-up on an assortment of fresh, vibrant flowers, showcasing dewy pink roses, creamy white lilies, and lush green eucalyptus, their delicate petals and textures bathed in natural light. The camera then performs a slow, elegant pull-back and a slight downward tilt, revealing the hands of a florist, resembling the woman in the input image, wearing a light blue turtleneck and a black apron with light pink straps. Her hands, adorned with a subtle gold ring, carefully select a flower stem, trim it with a small yellow-handled tool, and meticulously arrange it into a growing bouquet. A gentle, arcing camera movement observes the precise, graceful movements of her hands as she crafts the arrangement. Soft, diffused natural light illuminates the scene, highlighting the vibrant colors of the flowers and creating subtle reflections on her skin. The video concludes with a steady, medium shot of the beautifully finished, artfully arranged bouquet, held gently by the florist, emphasizing its delicate form and exquisite details. The atmosphere is serene, artistic, and captures the delicate beauty of floral creation.",
