Enhance the lighting to be soft and warm, and ensure all added elements and individuals blend seamlessly and realistically into the existing environment. Convey a sense of tranquil luxury and comfort.",
  "refined": "A luxurious outdoor spa environment, bathed in the soft, golden light of late afternoon. The elevated, rectangular spa from the input image, constructed with light beige stone tiles and filled with crystal-clear, light blue water, features dark integrated seating. The video begins with a slow, sweeping crane shot that reveals a person gracefully floating, half-submerged in the spa's warm water, their movements creating gentle ripples. Nearby, another individual is comfortably reclined on a sleek, minimalist lounge chair, partially visible in the foreground. The camera smoothly transitions to a gentle push-in, focusing on the tranquil activity. Soft, diffused steam subtly rises from the water's surface as the warm, low-angle sunlight highlights the texture of the stone tiling and creates shimmering reflections. The overall atmosphere is one of profound serenity, cozy comfort, and understated luxury, with a smooth, unhurried cinematic pace.",
