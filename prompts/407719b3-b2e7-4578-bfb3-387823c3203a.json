  "original": "Generate an 8-second, appetizing video ad for baking pizza. Begin with vibrant close-ups of fresh ingredients being prepped (0-2s). Transition to a rapid sequence showing sauce, cheese, toppings, and the pizza entering a hot oven, then cooking to perfection (3-6s). Conclude with a golden-brown pizza being pulled from the oven, a delicious cheese pull, and a text overlay like 'Fresh. Hot. Delicious.' (7-8s). Emphasize bright colors, close-ups, and satisfying cooking sounds.",
  "refined": "A brightly lit, clean kitchen countertop, possibly with rustic wooden accents, sets the scene. Two oval, pale dough pizza bases, topped with vibrant red tomato sauce and fresh green basil leaves, are centered on the surface. The video opens with a close-up on a hand, similar to the one in the input image, delicately sprinkling white grated cheese onto the sauced dough, followed by another hand adding more fresh basil. A slow dolly-in highlights the texture of the ingredients. A series of quick, dynamic cuts then showcases additional toppings being artfully placed, followed by a smooth shot of the prepared pizza sliding into a glowing hot brick oven, with a brief time-lapse of the crust bubbling and turning golden brown. The camera performs a slow zoom as a golden-brown, perfectly baked pizza is carefully pulled from the oven on a wooden peel. A close-up shot immediately follows, capturing a satisfying, stretchy cheese pull as a slice is lifted. The lighting is warm and inviting, emphasizing the rich, appetizing colors of the ingredients and the cooked pizza, creating an atmosphere of culinary delight and home-cooked warmth with crisp, clear visuals.",
