  "original": "Generate an 8-second video ad showing a mechanic expertly changing a car tire in a professional garage. Start with a shot of the car and worn tire (0-2s). Transition to a rapid montage of the mechanic efficiently performing key tire-changing actions (3-6s). Conclude with the mechanic giving a professional, trustworthy look and a simple text overlay like 'Fast. Reliable. Expert.' (7-8s). Emphasize clear visuals, tool sounds, and a clean, bright setting.",
  "refined": "A clean, brightly lit professional garage environment. The video opens with a medium shot on the glossy silver multi-spoke alloy wheel and its robust black rubber tire, securely mounted on a vehicle. A smooth camera dolly-in then reveals a mechanic, wearing a dark work shirt and light overalls, expertly using a black impact wrench to tighten the lug nuts on the wheel with precise, efficient movements. The camera subtly orbits the wheel from a low angle, highlighting the intricate spoke design and the detailed tire tread. As the final lug nut is secured, the mechanic glances up with a confident, trustworthy expression. The shot concludes with a steady, slightly wider view of the perfectly serviced wheel, bathed in bright, even overhead lighting, conveying professionalism and expertise.",
