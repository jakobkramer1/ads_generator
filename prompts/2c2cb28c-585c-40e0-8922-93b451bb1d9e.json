  "original": "Animate the provided image of the car engine close-up and the poised mechanic's hand. The hand must smoothly and realistically reach for a tool or begin the first precise mechanical adjustment on the engine component. Use a slow, cinematic camera movement (dolly or pan) that tracks the hand's action. Include subtle steam rising from the engine. All movement must be natural and realistic, avoiding any non-real visual effects.",
  "refined": "A detailed close-up in an industrial workshop setting features a mechanic's hand, encased in a form-fitting, matte black textile work glove with a distinctly woven cuff, poised over a small, dark, angular metallic engine component. The component shows subtle signs of wear and a slight oily sheen. The video begins with a steady medium close-up, then a slow, controlled dolly shot tracks the gloved hand as it smoothly descends. The flexible fingers of the black glove precisely manipulate or make a delicate adjustment to the intricate metallic component, demonstrating skill and focus. Simultaneously, faint wisps of steam gently rise from the engine's background, hinting at its operational state. Focused, practical lighting from an overhead source casts soft shadows, highlighting the glove's texture and the component's metallic surfaces. The overall tone is realistic, precise, and industrial, with natural and deliberate motion throughout.",
