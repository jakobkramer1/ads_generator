  "refined": "A woman's hands are in a bright, sun-drenched outdoor setting. One hand holds the matte off-white Suntribe Mineral Sunscreen tube, featuring its cream-colored label and distinctive teal tropical leaf illustrations. The tube's flip-top cap is open, and a thin line of white sunscreen is gently squeezed onto her other forearm, which her fingers then slowly and smoothly spread across her skin. The camera maintains a steady, medium close-up, highlighting the natural application under warm, bright sunlight, conveying a fresh and protective mood.",
